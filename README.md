# 🦀🕸 Rust-WASM Todo List

## About
<sub>Built with 🦀🕸 by [The Rust and WebAssembly Working Group](https://rustwasm.github.io/)</sub>

[**📚 Read this template tutorial! 📚**][template-docs]

This project is a simple Todo List application built using Rust and WebAssembly (WASM). It's one of the more unusual projects I've ever worked on, showcasing the power of Rust and WASM in a web application.

Be sure to check out [other `wasm-pack` tutorials online][tutorials] for other templates and usages of `wasm-pack`.

## 🔋 Batteries Included

* [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) for communicating between WebAssembly and JavaScript.
* [`console_error_panic_hook`](https://github.com/rustwasm/console_error_panic_hook) for logging panic messages to the developer console.
* `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT`: most Rust projects are licensed this way, so these are included for you.
